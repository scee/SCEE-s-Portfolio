                                        <span class="red" style="font-weight: bolder;">CZ</span> picked the name when he was going to buy a domain. And at the time, he didn't have anything in mind. He looked at the sky, and it was so blue that it made him think about the sea (SEA). Then his name (which starts with C) came to his mind. Right after, he thought about the word "see" (like the verb "to see") and realized that these words basically have the same pronunciation. So he put <span class="red">C</span> and SEE together to form "<span class="red">SCEE</span>". And most of the time, the letter "C" will have a <span class="red">different color</span>, so you can read "C", "see", and "scee" in <span class="red">every way</span>.
                                        
                                    </p>

                                        So just like that, the name was created ? Nothing more?
                                    </p>

                                        Actually, <span class="red">CZ</span> is a shy person who doesn't always like to be in the spotlight. If he could, he'd prefer to get rich in silence, and the more people thought about <span class="red">CZ</span> as an average person who doesn't do anything, the better (for him). He had this idea of making the brand <span class="red">without everyone knowing</span> who "<span class="red">CZ</span>" was: "<span class="red">So it's like we're making a lot of clothes, and a lot of people are buying them (eventually? [hopefully]), but they don't really know who's behind the brand or the designs,</span>" so you wouldn't <span class="red">SEE</span> him (and the team) moving.

                                    <p>If we put the letter "C" (which is sometimes red) in front of SEE + the domain, it could mean that you CAN'T SEE US (because it used to be scee.us), and "<span class="red">YoU WON'T SCEE US Moving</span>" was the first slogan.</p>

                        <h4>Here's another quick little story:</h4>
                        
                        <p>In July 2022, <span class="red">CZ</span> bought the domain and started using <span class="red">Print on Demand Services</span>. Feeling creative, he "created pieces and designs" that he thought were cool. He put them online in a Shopify store and started running ads on Pinterest.</p>
                        
                        <p>After approximately three months, the store had almost 1100 visits, but it wasn't making any money, so he decided to close it.</p>
                        
                        <p>Four or five months passed after closing the store. During this time, since he was doing <span class="red">everythingfor the first time</span> , <span class="red">CZ</span> realized he had learned a lot: more about clothing manufacturing and prices, improved skills on GIMP, made a beat for an ad, learned how to use a video editor to edit the ad, and tons of other things. The point is, <span class="red">he grew</span>. He didn't even want to sell anymore.</p>
                        
                        <p>For him, <span class="red">SCEE</span> became a <span class="red">state of mind</span>, and an encouragement to stand out, be different, and be creative. He wanted people to call him <span class="red">SCEE</span>, but he knew it would be weird, so he invented <span class="red">SceeZee</span> and shortened it to <span class="red">CZ</span>. The brand's slogan went from "<span class="red"></span>You won't SCEE Us Moving</span>" to "<span>Created to Create / Inspired by The Fear of Being Average</span>".</p>
                        
                        <p>He decided that he wanted it to be mostly <span class="red">private</span>, like a brand that's exclusively for friends and family, people he liked, people who liked the pieces, and managed to "<span class="red">understand</span>" that most of the designs had a meaning (and the actual <span class="red">meaning being the piece</span>). Friends and family wouldn't have to pay much for a piece, but it would be a whole different story for people who were not in his circle...</p>
                        
                        <p>Then he started making clothes again, this time with better style, quality, and more meaning than ever.</p>
                        
                        <br>

                            <p><span class="red">CZ</span>, as a person, is inherently private and values his anonymity. He doesn't like being in the spotlight and prefers to grow and succeed quietly. This personal preference translates directly into the way he envisions and operates <span class="red">SCEE</span>.</p>
